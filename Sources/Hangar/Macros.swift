/// `@Entity("posts")` — the macro that makes a struct a Hangar table
///. Generates:
///
/// 1. `Columns` — one typed `Column<T>` per stored property, for the
///    closure-based operators.
/// 2. A positional row decoder, `init(from: PostgresRow)` — compile-time
///    generated, no reflection, no string-keyed lookup per field.
/// 3. Table metadata (`schema`) — name, columns, primary key, insertable
///    vs. generated.
/// 4. A memberwise initializer (macro-generated because the compiler stops
///    synthesizing one once the macro adds `init(from:)`).
///
/// Association metadata (`@HasMany` et al.) arrives in Phase 3.
///
/// Table name is explicit — no pluralization inference, because inference
/// is wrong often enough that guessing costs more than typing.
///
/// Also generates the `Changesets.TableModel` conformance:
/// `tableName`, the `columns` keypath catalog, and the erased-value bind
/// switch — so `Changeset(Post.self)` and `repo.insert(changeset)` work
/// with no extra declarations.
