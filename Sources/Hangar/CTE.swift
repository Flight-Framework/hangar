// The typed half of Hangar stops at the CTE boundary on purpose. A CTE's
// body is a query shape the entity's own columns cannot describe: a
// recursive step references the CTE being defined, an aggregate rollup
// produces columns no `Table` declares. So the body is an `SQLFragment` —
// real binds, no string concatenation — and the *result* is typed, because
// a CTE that produces an entity's columns can be read back as that entity.
//
// The trick that makes reading typed with no rendering changes: a query
// reading from a CTE renders `FROM "cte_name" AS "entity_table"`. Every
// column reference downstream already qualifies with the entity's table
// name, so it resolves against the alias unchanged.
