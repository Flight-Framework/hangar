// An arbitrary-width joined query, built imperatively instead of typed at
// every arity. `JoinedQuery`/`JoinedQuery3` fix the join count in the
// type itself (`JoinedQuery<A, B, Result>`, `JoinedQuery3<A, B, C, Result>`),
// which means a fourth or fifth table needs a new struct and a full
// duplicate method surface, and every composition closure downstream
// takes one positional argument per table — keeping track of which
// position is which table is exactly the ergonomics problem this exists
// to fix.
//
// The insight this leans on: `SQLExpression`/`Predicate`/`OrderTerm`
// already carry only table/column *name strings* (see `Column.swift`,
// `Predicate.swift`) — nothing about rendering needs the joined Swift
// type once its ON-predicate is built. So the query value this produces,
// `ComposedQuery<Base, Result>`, only ever has two type parameters
// regardless of how many tables it joins; the join list is a plain
// array of erased clauses. What stays fully typed is the *builder*:
// `QueryBuilder.join(_:on:)` hands back the joined table's real
// `QueryColumns`, aliased, as an ordinary Swift value — so composing five
// joins reads as five `let` bindings, and every later predicate/select
// closure refers to them by name instead of by position.
//
// One thing does not survive erasure and so is captured eagerly at
// `join` time: whether the joined table is soft-deletable, and under
// which column. Without it the query could not apply the deleted-row
// scope to a joined source, which is precisely the hole the fixed-arity
// forms had.

/// comment for why that's safe.
