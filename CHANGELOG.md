adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- **Soft-delete scope is no longer dropped by joins.** `Query` applied the
  deleted-row scope through `effectivePredicate` on every read path; every
  *join* form rendered `predicate` directly and carried no scope at all. The
  conversion from a `Query` copied the predicate, the grouping, the row lock,
  even the preloads — and left the scope behind. So
  `StoredFile.all.join(Author.self, ...)` silently included deleted files, and
  `StoredFile.onlyDeleted().join(...)` — an *explicit* request for deleted rows
  only — silently returned every row instead, an explicit scope inverted by
  composition. `JoinedQuery`, `JoinedQuery3` and `ComposedQuery` now all carry
  a `DeletedRowScope`, with `withDeleted()`/`onlyDeleted()` on each.

  The rule, in one sentence: **the base entity is scoped in `WHERE`, every
  soft-deletable joined table excludes its own deleted rows in its `ON`
  clause, and `withDeleted()` lifts both.** `ON` rather than `WHERE` for the
  joined side is what keeps a `LEFT JOIN` outer — in `WHERE` the condition
  discards exactly the unmatched rows the outer join exists to keep, turning
  it into an inner join with nothing to see. `.only` scopes the base alone: a
  trash view of files still joins to live owners.

  **This changes the SQL existing join queries render** whenever a
  soft-deletable entity is involved. That is the point — the previous
  behavior was a wrong answer, not a contract — but a query that was
  compensating with its own `deletedAt == nil` predicate will now say it
  twice (harmless), and one that was *relying* on deleted rows appearing
  needs `withDeleted()` spelled out.

- **`ColumnDefinition`'s equality now includes `isDeletedAt`**, which its own
  doc-comment ("equality over every recorded property") already claimed.

- **`HangarVapor.RunningClient.init` no longer takes a `logger`** it never
  used — `PostgresClient` was handed its `backgroundLogger` at construction,
  so the parameter was only ever an unused argument at the single call site.
  (Released separately in `hangar-vapor`.)

- **`scripts/test.sh`'s docker-missing path** referenced `$pg_port` before
  assigning it, so under `set -u` the error message itself errored; the
  suggested export line was mangled by nested quoting. Both fixed, and the
  vestigial valkey container — defined and cleaned up, never started, copied
  from the Flight scripts — is gone.

### Added

- **`Table.query { }`: joins of any width, built by name instead of by
  position.** `JoinedQuery`/`JoinedQuery3` fix the join count in the type,
  so a fourth table needs a fourth struct and every downstream closure takes
  one positional argument per table. `Table.query { }` hands a builder whose
  every `q.join` mints a fresh alias and returns that table's typed columns
  as an ordinary `let`, so five joins read as five bindings:

  ```swift
  Order.query { q in
      let order = q.base
      let customer = q.join(Customer.self) { $0.id == order.customerID }
      let item = q.join(OrderItem.self) { $0.orderID == order.id }
      q.where(customer.active)
      return q.select(into: OrderReport.self) {
          (id: order.id, customer: customer.name, quantity: item.quantity)
      }
  }
  ```

  The value it produces, `ComposedQuery<Base, Result>`, has two type
  parameters however many tables it joins: `SQLExpression`/`OrderTerm` carry
  only name strings, so nothing about rendering needs the joined Swift type
  once its ON-predicate is built. Self-joins need no `.alias(_:)` — collision
  is impossible by construction. `repo.all`/`one`/`count`/`exists`, preloads
  on the base-entity path, and the soft-delete scope all work as they do on
  the fixed-arity forms; `count`/`exists` follow the same
  changes-what-a-row-is subquery rules. Mutating the builder after
  `q.query()`/`q.select` has snapshotted it traps rather than being silently
  ignored.

  `JoinedQuery`/`JoinedQuery3` stay — their closure form is nicer for a quick
  two-table join — but the arity is frozen there. There will be no
  `JoinedQuery4`.

- **`withDeleted()`/`onlyDeleted()` as sugar on the entity itself**, beside
  `where`/`order`/`limit`: `StoredFile.onlyDeleted().where { ... }`. The
  README showed this spelling before it existed, which is exactly what the
  compiled Snippets are for — the soft-delete section now has one.

- **A composite-key diagnostic on `@Entity`.** An entity with more than one
  `@ID` batches its has-many/has-one preloads on the first key column alone.
  That is a defensible convention; taking it silently is not, so the macro
  now warns and names the column it chose.

- **`HangarIntrospection` refuses to describe a composite foreign key.** It
  reads `con.conkey[1]`/`con.confkey[1]` — the first column pair — so the
  comment it emitted for a two-column constraint described a one-column key
  that does not exist, and the `@BelongsTo` shape it suggested alongside
  would not have worked. Composite constraints now carry their width and
  name and generate a TODO comment naming both, in the same spirit as the
  unmappable-type refusal.

- **Ordering comparisons against nullable columns.** `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
  now have `Column<V?>` overloads — `==`/`!=` already did. Without them, the
  most ordinary query a `@Deleted` column has ("purge everything soft-deleted
  before this date") did not compile, and neither did any range over a
  nullable timestamp (`closed_at`, `published_at`, `resolved_at`). The
  right-hand side stays non-optional: `deletedAt < nil` has no meaning in
  SQL, and keeping `nil` out of these signatures is what guarantees `== nil`
  still renders `IS NULL` rather than being captured by a new overload.
- **`debugSQL` coverage for every write and join shape added since the
  round-1 pass.** `Query.debugDeleteSQL()`, `Query.debugUpdateSQL(set:)`,
  `Array<Table>.debugInsertSQL()`, and `JoinedQuery3.debugSQL` /
  `.renderedQuery()` — bulk delete, bulk update, batch insert, and
  three-table joins previously had no way to see the SQL they render to
  without executing them. Added mainly to let `hangar-bench` measure these
  shapes client-side the same way every other query shape already was, but
  real API on its own: the same escape hatch `debugSQL` already gave every
  single-table and two-table query.
- **Benchmark coverage for everything Phase 0–7 and the 0.2.0 release
  added.** `hangar-bench` and `BENCHMARKS.md` had not been touched since
  before that work landed, so none of it — bulk delete/update, batch
  insert, three-table joins, pagination, soft delete, query diagnostics —
  had a measured number. Batch insert turned out to be the largest ratio in
  the whole file (~24× over individual round trips); soft delete and query
  diagnostics turned out to cost nothing measurable when idle, which is
  itself the finding worth having on record rather than assumed.

- **A `ComposedQuery` vs. `JoinedQuery3` comparison in `BENCHMARKS.md`**, the
  numbers `hangar-bench`'s own comment was already pointing at. The erased
  form is the cheaper one client-side (~1.15× rendering, ~1.24× projected,
  both reproduced across two runs) and indistinguishable end to end, where
  the round trip dominates. The bench's fixture seeding now goes through the
  batch insert rather than 480 individual round trips.

### Changed

- **The query-duration `Timer` stays per statement, on the record.** Caching
  the per-operation timers was tried and reverted:
  `Timer(label:dimensions:)` binds to whichever factory `MetricsSystem` held
  at construction, so a cached set binds to whatever was bootstrapped when
  the first query ran — and a process that bootstraps its backend afterwards
  then records into the no-op handler forever, silently. A library cannot
  control that ordering. Trading a robustness property for an allocation
  nothing has measured is the wrong direction for this package; the reason
  is now a comment in `Repo.execute` rather than something to re-discover.

- **Every database-touching test suite is gated.** `PostgresIntegrationSuite`
  now carries `.enabled(if: TestDatabase.isConfigured)`, which applies to
  everything nested inside it, and the six free-standing suites carry it
  directly. Nine of twenty-eight test files had the trait and seven that
  needed it did not — and a missing gate does not skip, it fails the run with
  `.notConfigured`, turning an unconfigured CI secret into what reads as a
  broken build. `swift test` with no `HANGAR_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is clean
  again.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **Soft delete.** `@Deleted var deletedAt: Date?` makes an entity
  soft-deletable: `repo.delete` stamps the column instead of removing the
  row, `repo.restore` clears it, and every read path excludes stamped rows by
  default. `withDeleted()` and `onlyDeleted()` select the other two views.
  The default applies uniformly — `all`, `one`, `count`, `exists`, joins,
  projections and preloads — because a soft delete that one code path forgets
  is worse than none: the row looks gone in a list and reappears in a count,
  and nothing errors. Preloaded children are excluded too, which is the case
  most implementations miss.
- **Common table expressions.** `with(_:as:)` and `withRecursive` define
  them; `reading(from:)` makes one the query's source, rendered as
  `FROM "cte" AS "entity_table"` so every column reference, ordering,
  predicate and preload downstream resolves against it unchanged. A
  non-recursive body may be a typed `Query`; a recursive one takes a typed
  anchor and a raw step, because the step refers to the CTE being defined and
  no entity's columns can describe that. `count`, `exists`, `delete` and
  `update` all carry the clause. A bulk write may be *fed* by a CTE but is
  refused if it tries to target one — `DELETE FROM "cte"` deletes nothing
  real.
- **Pagination.** `repo.page(query, PageRequest(...))` returns a `Page`
  carrying the slice and the total behind it. The count and the slice run
  sequentially rather than concurrently: two queries from one pool under a
  request-scoped connection is how a pool deadlocks under load.
- **Query diagnostics.** `QueryDiagnostics` surfaces slow queries against a
  configurable threshold, and `detectingRepeatedQueries` reports the N+1
  shape — the same statement issued repeatedly within one scope — which is
  the problem preloading exists to solve and the one nothing was measuring.
- **`EXPLAIN`.** `repo.explain(query, mode:)` returns the plan as text, or
  `ANALYZE`/`BUFFERS`/`VERBOSE` output. The diagnostics above say which query
  is slow; this says why.
- **Schema introspection** (`HangarIntrospection`, a separate product).
  `SchemaIntrospector` reads `pg_catalog` and `EntityGenerator` emits
  `@Entity` types from a live database — the path into Hangar for a schema
  that already exists. A separate product on purpose: generating models is a
  build-time chore, and nothing depending on Hangar at runtime should carry
  it.

### Fixed

- **Projections silently dropped the soft-delete scope.** `Query.rebinding` —
  the pivot `.select {}` goes through — copied every clause except
  `deletedRows`, so `.withDeleted().select {}` quietly went back to hiding
  deleted rows and `.onlyDeleted()` inverted to mean its opposite. A
  projection answering a different question than the query it came from is
  the class of bug this package refuses to ship; pinned by its own test.

### Changed

- `SQLFragment` rendering, the fragment-predicate path and the
  transaction escape hatch's statement rendering now share one
  implementation instead of three copies of the same parts loop.

### Infrastructure

- `scripts/test.sh` starts a throwaway Postgres, runs the whole suite through
  `CI/run-tests.sh`, and tears it down.
- `CI/run-tests.sh` reports both testing dialects. `swift test` exits non-zero
  for either, but its *output* does not say so in one place — which is how 13
  failing macro fixtures hid behind a green swift-testing summary.
- The database tests serialize against a shared lock; `withRepo` truncates
  shared fixture tables, so parallel suites were racing each other.
- A macOS build job, and the private-package token is now optional — every
  dependency is public, so a fork with no secret resolves fine.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **`@HasMany(through:)`** — many-to-many through a join table.
  `@HasMany(through: PostTag.self, from: \PostTag.postID, to: \PostTag.tagID)`
  preloads with two batched queries (join table, then related table), never a
  SQL join — the same shape as every other preload. The related key follows
  the `\Related.id` convention `@BelongsTo`'s `references` default already
  set. Per-parent ordering honors the tuned child query; duplicate join rows
  yield duplicate children; a join row referencing a vanished child is
  skipped, matching direct has-many's inner-join semantics. `.preload(\.tags)`
  is identical at the call site whichever kind the association is.
- **Two macro diagnostics that were silent failures.** `@BelongsTo` with an
  array argument (a has-many shape wearing the wrong attribute) used to
  escape into the expansion as uncompilable generated code with a baffling
  error; it now diagnoses at the property (`entity.belongstotype`). And
  `through:` on `@BelongsTo`/`@HasOne` diagnoses as `@HasMany`-only
  (`entity.throughkind`); missing `from:`/`to:` diagnoses `entity.throughkeys`.
- **Three-table joins.** `.join`/`.leftJoin` on any two-table join adds a
  third table, the on-closure and every later composition closure seeing all
  three column sets. Aliases work on any side, the ambiguity guard extends
  three ways, projections and preloads carry through, and `count`/`exists`
  follow the same clause rules as everywhere else. Ordinary generics, not a
  parameter-pack generalization: a compile spike confirmed a stored pack
  cannot be re-expanded into the on-closure call in this Swift version, so
  the pack form would compromise exactly the ergonomics that matter.
- **`DISTINCT ON`.** `distinct(on: { $0.authorID })` on single-table and
  joined queries alike — the "newest row per group" shape. Last-call-wins
  with `.distinct()`, counted through a subquery, refused by bulk writes.
- **`exists` for joined queries**, which had `count` but no `exists`.
- **Self-joins, via table aliases.** `Post.alias("parent").join(Post.alias("child"), on: ...)`
  renders `FROM "posts" AS "parent" JOIN "posts" AS "child"`, with every
  column reference — in the ON condition, later `.where`/`.order`/`.groupBy`
  closures, and the base entity's select list — qualified by its alias.
  Aliases are equally allowed on ordinary joins. An unaliased self-join is
  still refused, now with the remedy named; two sides aliased to the same
  name are refused too. The `@Entity`-generated `Columns` struct gained
  `init(table:)` (the `AliasableColumns` conformance) to make aliased column
  sets constructible; `Table.QueryColumns` is now constrained to it, which
  is source-breaking only for hand-written `Table` conformances — `@Entity`
  regenerates automatically.
- **Transaction isolation levels and retry.**
  `repo.transaction(isolation: .serializable) { }` applies the level to the
  outermost `BEGIN` (nested calls are savepoints and cannot change it), and
  `transaction(isolation:retryingOnSerializationFailure:_:)` re-runs the
  whole transaction on SQLSTATE `40001`/`40P01` — the standard SERIALIZABLE
  pattern, verified by a real write-skew contention test.
- **In-transaction escape hatch.** `repo.execute("SET LOCAL ...")` runs one
  raw statement, bind-safe under `SQLFragment`'s interpolation rules, on the
  transaction's own connection — which is what `SET LOCAL`, advisory locks,
  and DDL need, with no raw connection ever exposed.
- **Row locks as first-class query modifiers.** `Query.lockForUpdate()` /
  `.lockForShare()`. A locking read always routes to the primary, carries
  through joins rather than being silently dropped, is stripped from `count`
  (counting must not lock), and is refused by bulk writes (which take their
  own locks).
- **Batch insert.** `repo.insert([models])` — one multi-row `VALUES`
  statement, one round trip, results returned in input order with generated
  columns read back. Atomic as any single statement is: a constraint
  violation anywhere inserts nothing.
- **Bulk `update(query, set:)`.** One statement across every matching row,
  with typed, bound assignments and the row count returned:
  `repo.update(Post.where { $0.published == false }) { ($0.published.set(to: true)) }`.
  Same clause rules as bulk delete.
- **Bulk `delete(query)`.** `repo.delete(Session.where { $0.expiresAt < .now })`
  deletes every matching row in one statement and returns the count. A query
  carrying a clause DELETE cannot honor — LIMIT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING,
  DISTINCT — throws `HangarError.bulkWriteClause` rather than executing with
  the clause silently dropped.
- **Array column types.** `@Column var tags: [String]` maps to `text[]`, and
  likewise for `Bool`, `Int`/`Int16`/`Int32`/`Int64`, `Float`, `Double`,
  `UUID`, and `Date` elements — exactly the set PostgresNIO can code into a
  Postgres array. `Decimal` and `Data` have no array coding upstream, so
  `numeric[]`/`bytea[]` columns remain unsupported.

### Added (safety)

- **Escaped streams fail loudly.** `PostgresRowStream` is an ordinary
  `Sendable` struct, and Swift's `AsyncSequence` cannot be conformed to by a
  non-escapable type — so copying one out of its `stream { }` closure cannot
  be a compile error in this language version (verified against the 6.2.3
  stdlib's protocol declarations). It is now a runtime one: the connection
  lease expires when the closure returns, and the first `next()` after that
  throws `HangarError.streamLeaseExpired` instead of reading rows from a
  connection another query now owns.

### Changed

- **`MultiValues`' subscript throws instead of trapping.** A step reading a
  key whose step hasn't run, or a mistyped key, now fails that Multi's
  transaction and reports through `MultiResult.failure` — the right blast
  radius for a wiring bug discovered inside a live transaction is one rolled
  back transaction, not an aborted process. Call sites gain a `try`.

### Fixed

- **`SQLFragment` columns render table-qualified in multi-table scopes.**
  A fragment like `SQLFragment("char_length(\(p.title)) > \(n)")` inside a
  join previously rendered a bare `"title"` — ambiguous at best, silently
  resolved to the wrong table at worst. Qualification is now decided at
  render time, exactly as for columns outside fragments.

### Fixed

- **Joined `count` honored none of GROUP BY / HAVING / DISTINCT.** The
  single-table `count` was fixed in the last pass; the joined one still
  hand-rolled its SQL and ignored all three. Both now share the same rule:
  clauses that change what a row is count through a subquery.
- **`count` over a grouped, unprojected query now emits valid SQL.** It
  used to render the full column list inside the subquery — which Postgres
  rejects, since ungrouped columns can't appear — so the count that should
  have said "2 groups" said "ERROR". The grouping expressions themselves
  are the inner select list now: one row per group is exactly what is being
  counted.

### Fixed — silent wrong answers

Three bugs that rendered valid SQL and returned the wrong result. Nothing
threw and nothing logged, which is what makes this class of bug worth its own
test suite.

- **A join discarded the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` it was composed from.**
  `Post.groupBy { … }.join(…)` produced an ungrouped, unfiltered query. Building
  the join first happened to work, so composition order silently changed the
  result — and the documented example was written in the order that broke.
- **`count` and `exists` ignored `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `DISTINCT`.** Each
  changes what a row is, so counting without them answers a different question:
  a `count` over a grouped query returned 3 where the correct answer was 1.
  Those queries are now counted as a subquery. Ordering, limit, and offset are
  still ignored, because they do not change how many rows match.
- **A connection-bound `Repo` committed its caller's transaction.**
  `Repo(connection:)` assumed it was outermost, so `transaction { }` emitted a
  literal `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`. Handed a connection already inside a transaction —
  exactly what a framework integration does — Postgres ignored the redundant
  `BEGIN` and the `COMMIT` ended the caller's transaction, making writes the
  caller then rolled back durable.

  `Repo(connection:inTransaction:)` fixes it. Hangar cannot detect this
  itself, because PostgresNIO does not expose the connection's transaction
  status, so the caller declares it.

### Changed

- **`JoinedQuery2` is now `JoinedQuery`.** The `2` was arity, not a version,
  and every reader assumed otherwise.
- `HangarError` conforms to `LocalizedError`, so `localizedDescription` carries
  the real message rather than a Foundation placeholder.
- Diagnostic messages no longer cite internal design-document sections.

### Removed

- `SQLRenderer_quoteForTest`, a public global that existed only for a test that
  can use `@testable`.
- `TableSchema.insertPlaceholders`, computed for every schema and never read.

### Added

- `SilentWrongAnswerTests`, pinning all three bugs above — including a test
  that deliberately demonstrates the *hazardous* default of
  `Repo(connection:)`, so the parameter cannot be removed without a red test
  explaining what it was for.
- DocC catalog with two guides: preloading, and transactions and connections.
- LICENSE, CI with a Postgres service container, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG.

### Documentation and test coverage

- **Every public declaration is documented — 284 of 284, from 42%.** The
  quality bar is the one the already-documented half set: explain the what
  and the why, an example where non-obvious, never a restated signature.
- **Every macro diagnostic has a fixture — 20 of 20, from 7 of 18.** Each
  misuse's exact message, line, and column is pinned, so a rewording or a
  silently-vanished diagnostic fails a test instead of shipping. The two
  diagnostics added this cycle (`entity.belongstotype`, `entity.throughkind`/
  `entity.throughkeys`) are pinned alongside the eleven that never had one.
- The DocC guides no longer describe closed gaps as open: the transactions
  guide now documents isolation levels, retry, `execute`, and row locks; the
  preloading guide documents `@HasMany(through:)`.

### Documentation

- README rewritten for an external reader; it was a monorepo status log. It now
  states plainly what is missing — bulk writes, an in-transaction escape hatch,
  isolation levels, CTEs, three-table joins.
- All internal design-document references removed from source, tests, README,
  and benchmarks, including ones in test names that appear in CI output.
